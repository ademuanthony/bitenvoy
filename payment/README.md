## Dependencies

Micro services depend on service discovery. The default is multicast DNS, a zeroconf system.

In the event you need a resilient multi-host setup we recommend consul.

# install consul
brew install consul

# run consul
consul agent -dev
```

A Makefile is included for convenience

Build the binary

make build
```

Run the service
```

```

Build a docker image
```
make docker
```
